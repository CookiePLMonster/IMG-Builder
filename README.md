# IMG Builder
Native IMG Builder for GTA III, GTA Vice City and GTA San Andreas.

This tool allows you to build IMG files straight from directories, similarly to how Rockstar North built theirs.

## Building

Visual Studio 2015 is recommended, although any Visual Studio starting from 2010 should work just fine.

## Using

    imgbuilder path\to\ini.ini [output\path]

The tool requires a specific INI file formatting. Please look up `doc\example.ini` for a documentation of the used INI format.

## Help

For additional help, use:

    imgbuilder --help
